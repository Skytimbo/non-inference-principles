# Non-Inference Principles

This repository contains the **Non-Inference Principles v1.0 (NIP)**,
a normative technical standard defining *non-inference* as a
system-level, mechanistic property.

## Governance and Scope

at a technical level. 

This document is intended to be cited by implementations, licenses, certifications, and research efforts, but does not
itself impose enforcement, compliance, or legal obligations.

**Non-Inference Principles v1.0 (NIP)** as the authoritative technical
definition of Non-Inference.

The **Non-Inference License (NIL v0.3)**, used by certain QuantaIQ
repositories, normatively defers to this document for all technical
definitions.
